# Software Engineer UI Code Challenge

## Overview

This code test is for all levels.

Please plan to spend no more than 45 minutes to 1 hour on this. We understand we may not be the only company asking for an exercise from you and want to be respectful of your time, though you can spend longer perfecting your solution if you want to. We recommend you focus on the core requirements first, then work on any additional features if you have the time. By hour in, please feel free to stop working and explain what refactors / code organization / enhancements you would have made with more time in the `SOLUTION.md` file.

If you have any questions at any point, please reach out to us over email.

## Submission

Please submit a zipped copy or [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) of your code (excluding the `node_modules` folder) according to the instructions provided with this challenge.  If you have problems making a submission, please reach out to your talent coordinator for support.

## Challenge Description

We’ve included a simple Autocomplete/Typeahead component in vanilla ES2015 that lets you type in a query in a dropdown in order to see a list of matching results.

To see this component in action, let's set up the repo:

1. Run `yarn install`
1. Run `yarn start` (runs `webpack-dev-server`)
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

Type "new" in the input, and you'll get a list of matching US states that start with "new".

### Task

Currently, the component can only query against a static data array. Your task is to:

1. Enhance the component so that it also accepts an HTTP endpoint as a data source.

   For example, if you wire up the component to use `https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}&per_page={numOfResults}` and type `foo` in the input, the component dropdown should show Github users with logins that start with `foo`. When you select a user from the results, `item` in the `onSelect(item)` callback should be the selected Github user's id.

2. Implement keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results dropdown using up/down arrow keys and to select a result using the Enter key.

3. When an item in the dropdown is selected by mouse click or by hitting the Enter key, show the selected item below the search input(s).

4. Implement all stubbed tests in `./tests/Autocomplete-test.js` and ensure that `yarn run test` passes.

Uncomment the relevant sections in `index.js` and `index.html` to implement a demo that looks like this:

### Additional Requirements

- The component should be reusable. It should be possible to have multiple instances of the component on the same page.
- The "States" example that uses a data array should be enhanced with your code and continue to work.
- Your component should work correctly in Chrome, don’t worry about cross-browser compatibility.
- You can use small DOM helpers like jQuery or utilities from Lodash, but not larger libraries/frameworks like React, Angular or Vue.js
- You don't need to preserve any of the existing code; feel free to modify it as you wish.
- New APIs and your notes should be documented in `SOLUTION.md`.
